Travis Scott is an American rapper born with the name Jacques Bermon Webster II. Born in Houston, Texas in the early 90's, Scott turned 30 earlier this year in Spring of 2021. Scott has one child, Stormi Webster, with American model and influencer Kylie Jenner. Scott became interested in music in his teen years and started making his own beats when he was 17. In 2011 Scott then moved to Los Angeles from Texas. Upon his arrival he was signed to Grand Hustle Records, a major record deal company, in 2012. Then in 2015 Scott dropped his debut album followed by his next albums Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight and Astroworld in 2016 and 2018.

I consider Travis Scott my hero because he is so young yet successful. When he discovered his passion for music in college he dropped out to pursue his dreams. He never gave up on himself and was committed to building a life for himself. His music has reached number 1 on Billboard charts four times and has been in the top ten nine times. He has also been on the Artist 100 for 275 weeks. I admire his dedication and passion for what he does.
